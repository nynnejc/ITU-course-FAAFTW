# Major Web Project: Design and Interactive PrototypeAssignment

The Web project requires you to design and implement a working website using WordPress. You have a choice of either redesigning an existing website or creating your own portfolio site that is optimised for both desktop and mobile devices. 

For this part of the Web project, you will use design, layout and prototyping tools to define the information architecture of their site, produce visual designs of each page and produce an interactive prototype using Web-based prototyping tools. In the following part of the project, you will implement your design as a working Wordpress site.

The final deliverable for this item of project work is a clickable interactive prototype of the website which covers both desktop and mobile design. The prototype will consist of screen mockups and visual designs â€” no code will be written for this project deliverable.

This deliverable forms part of your major portfolio submission for this course. You can optionally submit this deliverable for written feedback. If you would like written feedback for this deliverable, please submit your deliverable via the LearnIT site by no later than Monday 25th February, 09:00 (beginning of Week 9). If submitted by this date, you will receive written feedback for this project by the beginning of Week 10.
