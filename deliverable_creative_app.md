# Creative Implementation of a Web AppAssignment

In this deliverable, you are given the opportunity to develop a Web application and to reflect on your theoretical understanding of 
the key concepts taught in this course. 

Your application can be anything you want it to be, and we encourage creative, interesting and innovative submissions. You are not 
constrained by specific functionality or technology for this component of the deliverable, given that it meets the following minimum 
requirements:

- Your application needs to be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use of libraries and frameworks that are based on these technologies 
are acceptable if they serve the needs of your application.
- Your app must fulfil the minimum technical requirements as described on the final page of this document.
As an example, you could implement a creative photo browser using the Flickr API; a smart, clean modern interface for a Web-based 
Weather app using the OpenWeatherApp API; or an augmented reality application written in React. For this deliverable, you are assessed 
on your judgment, creativity and understanding of modern Web technologies to shape an interesting and engaging user experience.

You are also required to submit a brief 500 word report that connects your implementation with the theoretical material taught within 
this course.
