## Deliverables

Throughout the semester, students are asked to produce three major deliverables that will form the basis of their oral examination. The deliverables are:

• Web Project - Design, Wireframes and Interactive Prototype
• Web Project - Implementation
• Creative Implementation of a Web App

### Web Project - Design, Wireframes and Interactive Prototype

The Web project requires you to design and implement a working website using
WordPress. You can either create your own portfolio website or re-design an existing site.
Your implemented site needs to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
For the first part of the Web project, you will use design, layout and prototyping tools to
define the information architecture of their site, produce visual designs of each page and
produce an interactive prototype using Web-based prototyping tools. The final
deliverable for this item of project work is a clickable interactive prototype of the website
which covers both desktop and mobile designs. The prototype will consist of screen
mockups and visual designs — no code will be written for this project deliverable.
Details of this deliverable will be released in Week 6. You can optionally receive feedback
for this deliverable if you submit it to LearnIT by the beginning of Week 9. If submitted by
this date, you will receive written feedback for this project by the beginning of Week 10.

### Web Project - Implementation

For the second part of the Web project, you will be required to implement your designs
as a working, fully functional, WordPress-driven site. You are required to use HTML and
CSS to layout the site, and implement these layouts as a custom WordPress theme so that
the site’s content can be deployed and updated. The layouts also need to be responsive
so that they are optimised for viewing on both mobile and desktop devices.
Details of this deliverable will be released in Week 11. You can optionally receive
feedback for this deliverable if you submit it to LearnIT by the beginning of Week 14. If
submitted by this date, you will receive written feedback for this project by the beginning
of Week 15.

### Creative Implementation of a Web App

In this deliverable, you are given the opportunity to develop a Web application. Your
application can be anything you want it to be, and we encourage creative, interesting and
innovative submissions as long as it fulfils the following technical requirements: that it is
built primarily using HTML, CSS and JavaScript; and that it either uses an API to retrieve
and process data and/or is built using React or Angular. As part of this deliverable, you
will also be required to submit a 500 word report based on the Diving Deeper: Blending
Theory and Practice modules.
Details of this deliverable will be released in Week 16. You can optionally receive
feedback for this deliverable if you submit it to LearnIT by the beginning of Week 18. If
submitted by this date, you will receive written feedback for this project by the beginning
of Week 19.
