# ITU-course-FAAFTW
Frameworks and Architectures for the Web spring 2020

This class is for MA students with no prior experience with programming, welcoming creative practitioners, people from the humanities and any other kind of academic disciplies with the aim of capturing their interest in the world of web development. 

*Learning objective:* In this class, students will learn about designing and building a web application. We will cover the basics of designing for the web: responsive design, accesability, web perfomance. Students are expected to engage in a critical discussion about the topic.

*Learning outcome:* Students will become knowledgeable about various ways of designing prototyping and implementing their ideas by building their own web application.

## Deliverables

Throughout the semester, students are asked to produce three major deliverables that will form the basis of their oral examination. The deliverables are:

- Web Project - Design, Wireframes and Interactive Prototype
- Web Project - Implementation
- Creative Implementation of a Web App

### Web Project - Design, Wireframes and Interactive Prototype

The Web project requires the student to design and implement a working website using
WordPress. Participants can either create their own portfolio website or re-design an existing site.
The site needs to be responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
For the first part of the Web project, students will use design, layout and prototyping tools to
define the information architecture of their site, produce visual designs of each page and
produce an interactive prototype using Web-based prototyping tools. The final
deliverable for this item of project work is a clickable interactive prototype of the website
which covers both desktop and mobile designs. The prototype will consist of screen
mockups and visual designs — no code will be written for this project deliverable.

### Web Project - Implementation

For the second part of the Web project, students will implement designs
as a working, fully functional, WordPress-driven site. It is required to use HTML and
CSS to layout the site, and implement these layouts as a custom WordPress theme so that
the site’s content can be deployed and updated. The layouts also need to be responsive
so that they are optimised for viewing on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Creative Implementation of a Web App

In this deliverable, students are given the opportunity to develop a Web application. The
application can be anything you want it to be, and creative, interesting and
innovative submissions are encouraged as long as it fulfils the following technical requirements: that it is
built primarily using HTML, CSS and JavaScript; and that it either uses an API to retrieve
and process data and/or is built using React. As part of this deliverable, students are also required to submit a 500 word report.

## Special Thanks

This course is a revised adaptation from the curicculum that was previously used for this classs by [Tim Wray](https://pure.itu.dk/portal/en/persons/tim-wray(f90a0487-b539-4132-82a4-4aee76dbfe52).html). It takes inspiration from courses the instructor has helped teach and develop at [Hack Your Future Copenhagen](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum), which has been made in close collaboration with [Hack Your Future Amsterdam](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/curriculum). A large section of the links section has been adapted from Andreas Mehlsen's comprehensive and well-updated [web skills guide](https://andreasbm.github.io/web-skills/). This course has also benefitted from inspiration from Rune Madsen's course [Programming Design Systems](https://runemadsen.com/syllabi/programming-design-systems/) and wouldn't have been possible without support from members of the Copenhagen web developer community. Many thanks!
