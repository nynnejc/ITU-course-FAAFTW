# Major Web Project: ImplementationAssignment
The Web project requires you to design and implement a working website using WordPress. You have a choice of either redesigning an 
existing website or creating your own portfolio site that is optimised for both desktop and mobile devices. 

The final deliverable for this item of project work consists of: 

- Static HTML & CSS files based on your design. 
- A working WordPress theme based on your design. 
- A URL link to your WordPress site, with data and/or content from your design OR a screen recording of your WordPress site as 
running locally on your own computer.

For this part of the Web project, you will implement your design as a functional WordPress site. You are required to use HTML and CSS to 
layout the site, and implement 
these layouts as a custom WordPress theme so that the siteâ€™s content can be deployed and updated.
