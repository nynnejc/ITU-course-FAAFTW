# Progressive Web Applications

In this lecture, we'll introduce Progressive Web Applications, which are Web applications that offer the functionality and benefits of native applications, such as the ability to access the camera and sensor hardware on mobile devices, push notifications and the ability to work offline. We'll also dive deeper into the different affordances and design considerations of developing mobile apps using Web-based (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), native (Java, Objective-C, Swift) and hybrid frameworks.
