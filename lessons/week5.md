# Introduction, HTML syntax, structure and Semantics

In this lecture, you'll be given an overview of the course and its expectations. We'll briefly talk about the deliverables and exam format for the course, we can showcase some projects from last year so you can get an idea of what you can achieve by completing this course. We'll also provide a very brief introduction to HTML syntax, structure and semantics, familiarise yourself with a platform where you can experiment with HTML, and start ideating design ideas for your first Major Web project.

## Introduction to HTML

HTML is the foundation of web development. It is an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is used to structure content on a webpage. What do we mean by content? Plain text, images, videos, links to other websites, etc. The structure gives content meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.

### The commonly used tags

The most important thing to know is that the tags are used to **structure content**, or in other words: to decide how each part is organized in order to more easily understand what the page is trying to communicate.

It's useful to memorize this list, but don't feel like you have to learn and memorize _every_ HTML tag. Once you understand the basics, you can easily look up which tag you need.

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML are HTML tags that introduce meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a `<p>` tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. A `<nav>` tag indicates a navigation menu of some kind. Both examples show meaning and structure, in this way it's easier to understand for both the browser and the developer.

This leads to the following insight about writing code: while code is written to produce working software, it should also be written so **other developers can easily read and understand it**. You'll learn more about that later.

## Intro to Website Wireframing

The Major Web Project requires you to design and implement a website and the best Web designs always start on paper. Wireframing allows you to design and ideate "the big picture" of your website without focussing too much on the details. Read more about the process of wireframing and why it's useful.

## Additional Reading

## What is the command line interface (CLI)?

The Command Line interface (also known as CLI or shell) is a way to navigate through your computer's content (media, folders, applications, etc.) without a visual user interface. It allows you to type text commands to perform specific tasks. Since you can directly control the computer by typing, many tasks can be performed more quickly, and some tasks can be automated with special commands that loop through and perform the same action on many files.

As a beginning programmer it's important to get familiar with it, as it will teach you how computers work: As a tool that you give instructions to. This is not any different from programming for web development; but instead of writing instructions to the computer directly, you write instructions for browsers to execute.
