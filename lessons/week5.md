# Introduction, HTML syntax, structure and Semantics

## Introduction to HTML

HTML is the foundation of web development. It is an acronym for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is used to structure content on a webpage. What do we mean by content? Plain text, images, videos, links to other websites, etc. The structure gives content meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images.

### The commonly used tags

The most important thing to know is that the tags are used to **structure content**, or in other words: to decide how each part is organized in order to more easily understand what the page is trying to communicate.

It's useful to memorize this list, but don't feel like you have to learn and memorize _every_ HTML tag. Once you understand the basics, you can easily look up which tag you need.

Check out the following article to find a list of the most commonly used tags: [The Most Commonly Used Tags](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/most-commonly-used-tags-in-html/)

## Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML are HTML tags that introduce meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a `<p>` tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. A `<nav>` tag indicates a navigation menu of some kind. Both examples show meaning and structure, in this way it's easier to understand for both the browser and the developer.

This leads to the following insight about writing code: while code is written to produce working software, it should also be written so **other developers can easily read and understand it**. You'll learn more about that later.

## What is the command line interface (CLI)?

The Command Line interface (also known as CLI or shell) is a way to navigate through your computer's content (media, folders, applications, etc.) without a visual user interface. It allows you to type text commands to perform specific tasks. Since you can directly control the computer by typing, many tasks can be performed more quickly, and some tasks can be automated with special commands that loop through and perform the same action on many files.

As a beginning programmer it's important to get familiar with it, as it will teach you how computers work: As a tool that you give instructions to. This is not any different from programming for web development; but instead of writing instructions to the computer directly, you write instructions for browsers to execute.
