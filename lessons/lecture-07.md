# Web Accesibility

Guest lecturer: Digital Accessibility Specialist Tobias Christian Jensen.

Web Accessibility is important to learn about so that we can make sure that the Web is open and inclusive for all. This class will center around key concepts of accesability.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a set of recommendations that make Web content more accessible. These guidelines are very comprehensive and are categorised according to the following principles:

1. Perceivable - information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
2. Operable - User interface components and navigation must be operable.
3. Understandable - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
4. Robust - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## The A11y Project
Accesability on the web is a living, breathing, constantly changing phenomea. Therefore it is all the more useful to keep an eye on The Accessibility (A11Y) Project. This is a community-driven effort to make web accessibility easier by open-sourcing guides and resource lists.
