# Document Object Model and Events in JavaScript

This lecture will introduce the Document Object Model (DOM) and event handling system in JavaScript.

## DOM (Document Object Model)
The DOM (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).

The DOM is one of the most-used APIs on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

## Events in JavaScript
In Web Applications, we add interactivity through the use of events. Events are “things that happen”, such as mouse clicks, pressing a key on a keyboard, or downloading data via a network request. We add interactivity by “listening” to events on DOM elements. For example, a button would ‘listen’ to a click, and then your program could do something in response to that click, such as displaying a message or altering the state of your application.
