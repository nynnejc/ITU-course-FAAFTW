# React Part I

### Components
- Understanding the component model.
- Break down a site into components.
- Reusable blocks of JavaScript & HTML.
- Each component instance can be given different data.
- Can display JavaScript values in the HTML, using the { } symbols.
- Class component vs. functional component.
- Always returns HTML (in the form of JSX).
- Render an array in .map.

### JSX
- A way to write dynamic HTML code with JavaScript.
- It is a more intuitive version of the function createElement().
- show https://babeljs.io/repl write converted to "use strict"; React.createElement("div", null);
- A component should always return JSX.
- These are the parts that will build the DOM structure.
- ReactDOM.render.

### Props
- Props is short for property (like a regular HTML attribute).
- It is (dynamic) data that can be given to child components.
- Passed down using an identifier, a self-defined attribute name.
- Can be given to multiple instances of components.

### State
- State holds all the dynamic data of the app.
- State can only be defined in class-based components.
- Initialization of state in constructor.
