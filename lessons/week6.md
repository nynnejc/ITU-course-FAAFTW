### Responsive design with media queries

Web developers must learn to design for various device sizes: desktops, tablets and mobile phones. Responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size of the viewer. It prevents that images are larger than the screen width, so visitors on mobile devices will see a visually attractive website as well

The primary way of making a responsive website is by writing custom CSS code that makes it so. This can be done using `media queries`: CSS instructions that only apply to certain screen sizes.
