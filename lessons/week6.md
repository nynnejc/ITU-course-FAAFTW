# Interface, Principles, Design Patterns and Aesthetics

In this lecture, we'll introduce the first major deliverable of the course and we'll briefly introduce an overview of some design related topics. This lesson will cover visual perception, Gestalt theory, design principles, patterns and tools. We'll introduce best practice design and prototyping tools that will help you in completing the first major deliverable of the course, and in any future project work that you may undertake as part of your study program and beyond.

## Usability

According to Steve Krug, usabilityt is a quality that makes a product:
Useful. Is it something that people need?
Learnable. Can people figure out how to use it?
Memorable. Do people need to re-learn how
to use the product?
Effective/Efficient. Does it get the job done with a
reasonable amount of time and
effort?
Desirable. Is this something that people
want?
Delightful. Is using it enjoyable, delightful,
pleasing or even fun?

## Usability Heuristics

Heuristics are broad rules of thumb to consider when
designing and evaluating user interfaces.

## Visual Perception and Gestalt Principles

Our eyes and our minds are our tools of perception. We can intuitively sense that good design and bad design can be
boiled down to an understanding of perception.
 
Human perception is dictated by relationships: how things stand out or blend in; how things are similar and dissimilar; and how they
contrast and blend with one another. It dictates how hierarchies are formed based on the way we organise things. It gives us the 
separation of attention from noise, and content from context.

Gestalt principles will guide you on how to do that. How to create hierarchy; when and where to use delineation;
understand how contrast and similarity can be used to create pleasing, clear and concise visual explanations of your design.
An understanding of Gestalt principles simplifies the design process, allowing you to much better articulate your creative ideas.

## Figma 

Figma is used to design, prototype and share designs in real time, draw lines, shapes, boxes and place content, images and text, layout using gridlines and auto-layout tools, scale designs and components so it is easy / possible to create responsive designs.Figma can also be used to abstract commonly used pieces of a design (such as buttons or menu bars) into components: therefore promoting reuse and principles of DRY (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”).

## Responsive design with media queries

Web developers must learn to design for various device sizes: desktops, tablets and mobile phones. Responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size of the viewer. It prevents that images are larger than the screen width, so visitors on mobile devices will see a visually attractive website as well

- [Responsive Design](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/responsive-design/).

The primary way of making a responsive website is by writing custom CSS code that makes it so. This can be done using `media queries`: CSS instructions that only apply to certain screen sizes.
