### Responsive design with media queries

Nowadays people use different devices to access websites: desktops, tablets and mobile phones of all different sizes. Responsive design is a way to put together a website so that it automatically scales its content and elements to match the screen size of the viewer. It prevents that images are larger than the screen width, so visitors on mobile devices will see a visually attractive website as well

The primary way of making a responsive website is by writing custom CSS code that makes it so. This can be done using `media queries`: CSS instructions that only apply to certain screen sizes.
